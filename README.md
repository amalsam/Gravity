# Particle Simulation

This project is a simple particle simulation implemented in Python using Pygame. It simulates the motion of particles under the influence of gravitational forces.

## Description

The simulation consists of particles moving within a defined space, interacting with each other based on gravitational attraction. The particles are represented as small circles on the screen, and their motion is calculated using Newtonian mechanics.

## Installation

To run the simulation, make sure you have Python,Numba and Pygame installed on your system. You can install Pygame using the following command:

'''pip install pygame '''
'''pip install numba'''


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the main script using Python:


4. Once the simulation window opens, you can interact with it by:
   - Adding particles: Press and hold the left CTRL key and click on the screen to add particles at the cursor position.
   - Generating particle configurations:
     - Press '1' to generate a line of particles at the current Y-coordinate of the cursor.
     - Press '2' to generate a circular cluster of particles around the cursor position.
     - Press '3' to generate a line of particles at the current X-coordinate of the cursor.

5. Observe the particles' motion and interactions as they move around the screen.
